# Python Topology Object for Molecular Symulation pyTOMS
This program provides functionalities for molecular topology handling for MD simulations, especially for GROMACS but also for conversions between GROMACS and LAMMPS. <br>
It also includes utilities for creating coarse-grained topology from all-atom representations.
